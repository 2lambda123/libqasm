# libqasm sources

This directory contains the sources for libqasm, as well as some generated files after building:

 - `cqasm`: this directory contains the self-contained sources for the new API, as well as the guts of the library it depends on, including the current flex/bison parser.
 - `library`: this directory contains the compatibility layer for the original API, now built on top of the new API instead of the original flex/bison parser.
 - `tests`: this directory contains the tests for the original API, as well as its Python bindings.

The following folders may be generated:

 - `cbuild`: when building the C++ library, the toplevel readme file instructs you to build from here. `setup.py` also builds here, unless called through `pip` directly. On Linux, MacOS, and Windows using MinGW, most build artifacts are placed in the root of this directory. On Windows using MSVC, some of the artifacts are placed in its `Debug` subdirectory.
 - `libQasm`: the Python library output files generated by `setup.py`.
