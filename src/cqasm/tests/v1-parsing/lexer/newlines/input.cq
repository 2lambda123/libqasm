# Instructions are normally separated by newlines.
x q[0]

# You can also use semicolons.
x q[1]; x q[2];

# Since newlines have a syntactical meaning, they can't go everywhere. However,
# you can escape newlines:
x \
q[3]

# Newlines are legal/used in a few other places, notably matrices. The
# following are equivalent:
u q[4], [
    0, 1
    1, 0
]

u q[5], [0, 1
         1, 0]

u q[6], [0, 1; 1, 0]

# This is also equivalent to the following old matrix notation:
u q[7], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

# Strings can contain embedded newlines, because why not:
load_state "Hello,
I'm a multiline string."

# And so can JSON, of course:
display @an_annotation.with_json({|
    "json": "object"
|})
